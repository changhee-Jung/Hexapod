To build and execute a C# sample application, the following additional files are required:
- PI_GCS2_DLL.dll
- PI_GCS2_DLL_x64.dll
- PI_GCS2.cs

Proceed as follows to make these files available for the application:
1) Install the feature “PI_Programming_Files_PI_GCS2_DLL_Setup.exe” from the product CD. Afterwards, the required files will be located in “C:\Users\Public\PI\PI_Programming_Files_PI_GCS2_DLL”.
2) Copy these files to the location where the source code is built (.cs) and where the application is executed (.dll).
